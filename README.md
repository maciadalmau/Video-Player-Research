# Video-Player-Research

Hi, I'm Maci√† Dalmau and welcome to my Video Player. This project has been made for the personal research assignment of the subject Project 2 in the Video Game design and development Degree in CITM, UPC.

## What's a Video Player?

## Video Player in video games

In video games, the Video Player don't need so many functionalities. They usually have the options of play, pause and skip the video. But why is important on video games? Mainly for two very important reasons:

The importance of cinematics in video games gives the audience an idea of what a video game will be and gives animators the opportunity to attract potential customers. The cinema and animated scenes in the game offer even more creativity and content in an already exciting form of entertainment. The use of short movies in games, regardless of the type of game, increases the value and provides a method of engaging the player even more than before. Also, cinematics are a cool way to tell the story.

Sometimes, the scene you want to make in your video game is too complex to be processed in real time or basically you just don't want your team of developers to spend time creating a cinematic. Then you will need a pre-rendered scene and you will need a video player to process this pre-rendered scene in your game.

## Pre-rendered cutscenes vs real time cutscenes

In video games cutscenes can be classified in many ways, but when talking about video rendering, there are two different categories: pre-rendered and real time cutscenes. Pre-rendered cutscenes, as the name implies, are cutscenes that have been rendered before, and the game just plays the cutscene with his video player. On the other hand we have real time cutscenes use the game engine to generate a cutscene that is rendered while the game is playing.

## Video file

Before we start looking for the implementation I want to say something short about what a video file is.

A video file has three main parts:

The container format is just a way of packing the audio and video data in a single file, togheter whit some additional information.
